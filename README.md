# Fire Security Alarm System using ATMEGA328 Microcontroller

In this project, we are going to make a Fire Security Alarm System using ATMEGA328 microcontroller and fire sensor. Fire sensor can be of any type, however we are using IR (Infrared) based Fire Sensor. Although IR based Fire Sensors have some disadvantages mostly of inaccuracy, it is the cheapest and easiest way to detect fire.
